# **About**

I am currently a middle school math teacher at [Marymount School](https://www.marymountbq.edu.co/web/) (Barranquilla), with three years of teaching experience. I am passionate about helping students truly understand the world of numbers. I earned my Bachelor's degree in [Mathematics](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/matematicas?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=pre_google_inscripciones_202430&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwr7ayBhAPEiwA6EIGxMMrIy6m_J36jSVpYSGL6iM593zUPSUK-swEBcVSlr09MKxAHsPZRRoCQ4YQAvD_BwE) from Universidad del Norte, where I developed a strong interest in algebra and group theory. Since 2023, I have been pursuing a Master's degree in [Applied Statistics](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/maestria-en-estadistica-aplicada) at Universidad del Norte, aiming to deepen my knowledge in biostatistics and machine learning.
